7 Application = 
6 Presentation = Encrypts if necessary, zip
5 Session = session id
pres + session = convert that thing we want to transmit into serialized info
                establish conx, Dialogue
4 trans = segment, manage ports(src/dest)
            segmentation and reassembly
            speed matching mechanism
            TCP/UDP
layer 5 and 6 are useless, we skip them most of the time
3 net/ip protocol = Packets / add ip(src/dest) + other headers
2 Data Link = moving frames(HDLC/PPP) - Hop to Hop data delivery
              MAC + LLC
              - error control/ flow control(speed matching)
              Frames / deal with mac address / (error detection..) small pieces ARP(Mac->IP) | deals with mac adrs
              corrects errors that may occur in the physical layer
              Sliding Window Protocol (https://youtu.be/LnbvhoxHn8M)
              High-level Data Link Control (HDLC) is a group of communication protocols of the data link layer for transmitting data between network points or nodes. Since it is a data link protocol, data is organized into frames. A frame is transmitted via the network to the destination that verifies its successful arrival.

              Multiple Access Protocols = avoid talking simultaneously aka collision 
                                          Random access protocol (CSMA/CD..) = any station has the right to acess and send data
                                          CSMA = carrier(medium/chanel) sense protocol aka "listen before talk"

1 Physical = frame into ones and zeros (electricity doesn't has direction aka broadcast) 
            converts the digital bits into electrical, radio, or optical signals.

this data(binary) will be sent to everyone
then send them up to make sense
Data link receives all the frames checks adres and rejects them if not the right host
each layer towards up removes its added headers..


switch goes only to layer 2
hub to layer 3
router 3

Hub = im not smart enough so broadcast the frame to all, machines accept it or drops it (its for me or not)
the network become very busy

switch works smarter(looks at the content) + remembers (tables)

*******************************************************************

protocol data unit (PDU) is a single unit of information transmitted among peer entities of a computer network.
(packet, segment, datagram)
PDU (Protocol Data Unit) is a generic term used to refer to the packets in different layers of the OSI model.

Packet:

data bytes have a specific format in the OSI networking model since each layer has its specific unit

The basic unit of communication between a source and a destination in a network is a packet.
Data sent through the network is divided into packets

Fragment:

Packets can often be larger than the MTU, so each packet is also divided into smaller pieces of data called fragments.
each network has its own MTU capacity. 
If the packet length is bigger than the MTU, the network layer checks the Don’t Fragment (DF) flag associated with the packet. If the DF flag is \mathsf{1}, we discard the packet. Otherwise, the network layer decides the size of the fragments, 
create the header, encapsulate the fragments within the header, and send them to the next layer:

Frame:
The main difference between a packet and a frame is the association with the OSI layers.

While a packet is the unit of data used in the network layer, 
a frame is the unit of data used in the OSI model's data link layer. 
Frames are not much different from packets. They contain more information about the data. 
The process of framing consists of adding some extra bytes into the packet turning it into the frame

Packet + extra info/headers = Frame

Datagram:
While TCP uses packets in connection-oriented protocols, datagrams are used in UDP

Application = Data
Transprt = Segments/Datagrams  : ACK, packet segmentation(MTU)
Internet = Packets = addressing , routing
Data Link = Frames
Physical = bit

VLAN is a layer 2 concept (frames)
 VLAN tagging

A switching loop or bridge loop occurs in computer networks when there is more than one layer 2 path between two endpoints
(e.g. multiple connections between two network switches or two ports on the same switch connected to each other).
The loop creates broadcast storms as broadcasts and multicasts are forwarded by switches out every port, 
the switch or switches will repeatedly rebroadcast the broadcast messages flooding the network.
Since the layer-2 header does not include a time to live (TTL) field, if a frame is sent into a looped topology,it can loop forever

Routing loops are tempered by a time to live (TTL) field in layer-3 packet header; Packets will circulate the routing loop until their TTL value expires.
 No TTL concept exists at layer 2 and packets in a switching loop will circulate until dropped

broadcast storm
A packet that induces such a storm is occasionally nicknamed a Chernobyl packet.
a broadcast storm can be instigated for the purpose of a denial of service (DOS) 

==> Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) prevents broadcast loops, blocks the redundant link(will be used when active links or ports goes down)

Layer 2 loops


In Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) terminology, a service data unit (SDU) is a unit of data that has been passed down from an OSI layer or sublayer to a lower layer. This unit of data (SDU) has not yet been encapsulated into a protocol data unit (PDU) by the lower layer. That SDU is then encapsulated into the lower layer's PDU and the process continues until reaching the PHY, physical, or lowest layer of the OSI stack.

At the receiving device the data is passed from the lowest to the highest layer as a series of SDUs while being successively stripped from each layer's header or footer until reaching the topmost layer, where the last of the data is consumed


Fragmentation is a phenomenon in which storage space is used inefficiently, reducing capacity or performance and often both.
Segmentation is the process of dividing the computer’s primary memory into segments or sections.

Fragmentation, 
a process in which free memory space is broken into little pieces. In this, memory blocks cannot be allocated to processes due to their small size and such blocks remain unused. It usually occurs in dynamic memory allocation system when many of free blocks are too small to satisfy any request

ip = location of a person (router friendly)
MAC = name of the person (switch friendly)
(https://youtu.be/FkiTOMn-XGw?list=PLBlnK6fEyqRgMCUAG0XRw78UA8qnv6jEx)

reaching the city (find the network)
reaching the appartment (find the host)
reaching the right person (the port)

ip adr says who are u in the network
subnet mask says who are ur neighbors in the network

==
Switch => three operations :
        learn
        flood
        forwrd
        
 ====
 internet is nothing more than a series of routers
