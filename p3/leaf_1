========================

---


When EVPN is enabled on a VTEP, all locally defined VNIs on that switch and other information (such as MAC addresses) are advertised to EVPN peers.

1/ configured VXLAN interfaces, attached them to a bridge, and mapped VLANs to VNIs.
2/ Enable EVPN between BGP Neighbors
        add the address family evpn to the existing neighbor address-family 

            address-family l2vpn evpn
            neighbor 1.1.1.1 activate

3/ advertise-all-vni (This configuration is only needed on leaf switches that are VTEPs )
        enable the BGP control plane for all VNIs configured on the switch.

neighbor 1.1.1.1 update-source loopback
 If multiple paths exist between the iBGP routers, using a loopback interface as the neighbor address can add stability to the network. With this command, stability can be achieved by providing the loopback interface address as the source address of the TCP/IP session.

"There are two paths between A and B. And that justifies the use of update-source in the neighbor command"


https://shortest.link/55Mo

Its not needed at all by default. You only use it when you want your router to use a specific IP address when exchanging BGP updates with another router.

A common configuration is to have a loopback interface on your router and then to use under your BGP config

router bgp 100

neighbor x.x.x.x loopback 10

But you can have an iBGP between a loopback on R1 and the physical interface on R2.


 the purpose of the the update-source command in BGP.

  is used to specify that we will use the loopback interfaces as the source for the IBGP session.

R4(config-router)# neighbor 2.2.2.2 update-source loopback 0

=====

address-family l2vpn evpn

Selects the L2VPN EVPN address family.

Specifies address family to use and changes to the configuration context for the specified family


  address-family l2vpn evpn
The spine activates the l2vpn evpn address family to signal to its peers that it can process EVPN routes.

====

 neighbor 1.1.1.1 activate

  enables the address-family capability and exchange of information specific to an address family with a BGP neighbor.

===

neighbor 1.1.1.1 remote-as 1

Creates a peer, initiates the connection to the peer, and adds an entry to the BGP neighbor table. Specifies a neighbor with an autonomous system (AS) number that identifies the neighbor as internal to the local autonomous system. 

Neighbor <peer group name> remote-as < as-number>
	Mettez à jour la table de voisins BGP IPv4 avec l’adresse IPv4 du voisin dans le système autonome spécifié.

Enable EVPN in an iBGP Environment with an OSPF Underlay

You can use EVPN with an OSPF or static route underlay. This is a more complex configuration than using eBGP. In this case, iBGP advertises EVPN routes directly between VTEPs and the spines are unaware of EVPN or BGP.


In a centralized routing deployment, you must configure layer 3 interfaces even if the switch is configured only for layer 2 (you are not using VXLAN routing). To avoid unnecessary layer 3 information from being installed, configure the ip forward off or ip6 forward off options as appropriate on the VLANs.

Configuration de BGP

 https://docs.citrix.com/fr-fr/citrix-adc/current-release/networking/ip-routing/configuring-dynamic-routes/configuring-bgp.html



 The neighbor command must be repeated to configure various parameters such as advertisement interval, activation, and so on.
